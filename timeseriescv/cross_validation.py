class BaseTimeSeriesCrossValidator:
    """
    Abstract class for time series cross-validation.
    Time series cross-validation requires each sample has a prediction time pred_time,
    at which the features are used to predict the response,
    and an evaluation time eval_time, at which the response is known and the error can be computed.
    Importantly, it means that unlike in standard sklearn cross-validation,
    the samples X, response y,
    pred_times and eval_times must all be pandas dataframe/series having the same index.
    It is also assumed that the
    samples are time-ordered with respect to the prediction time (i.e. pred_times is non-decreasing).

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=10
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

class CombPurgedKFoldCV(BaseTimeSeriesCrossValidator):
    """
    Purged and embargoed combinatorial cross-validation

    As described in Advances in financial machine learning, Marcos Lopez de Prado, 2018.

    The samples are decomposed into n_splits folds containing equal numbers of samples, without shuffling.
    In each cross validation round, n_test_splits folds are used as the test set,
    while the other folds are used as the train set.
    There are as many rounds as n_test_splits folds among the n_splits folds.

    Each sample should be tagged with a prediction time pred_time and an evaluation time eval_time.
    The split is such that the intervals [pred_times, eval_times] associated to samples
    in the train and test set do not overlap.
    (The overlapping samples are dropped.) In addition, an "embargo" period is defined, giving the minimal time between an
    evaluation time in the test set and a prediction time in the training set. This is to avoid, in the presence of
    temporal correlation, a contamination of the test set by the train set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=10
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

    n_test_splits : int, default=2
        Number of folds used in the test set. Must be at least 1.

    embargo_td : pd.Timedelta, default=0
        Embargo period (see explanations above).
